# WHAT DOES RECORD/REPLAY DO?

* Record/Replay lets you run end-to-end functional tests on your web site / application.

* Our automated tests give you quick feedback on whether your application works as intended. 

* Tests run in your Chrome browser so Record/Replay works no matter how you develop your application, be it React, Angular, Vue or some other framework.

* We aim to serve all developers, from those with no programming experience to those with experience of multiple testing frameworks. 

* Check out Record/Replay in action on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/dXmjvsvPXIM) 

# HOW DOES RECORD/REPLAY WORK? 

__RECORD__ - Listens for all user interface interactions through keyboard and mouse, including steps required for key functionality, such as signup, login, add purchase to cart etc.

__REPLAY__ - Simulates all recorded user interface interactions (clicking, typing, scrolling etc.), ensuring that these scenarios actually work from the point of view of an end user.

__REPORT__ - Provides feedback on the execution of user interface interactions, including detailed logging of user interface interaction fails and visual regression analysis of screenshots.

# WHY SHOULD YOU INSTALL RECORD/REPLAY?

As you develop, especially before you deploy to production, you want to know that all the key functionality of your application really works.
You donâ€™t want your users to find the bugs before you do.

Yet manual end-to-end functional testing is time-consuming and tedious. It is a prime candidate for automation. 
Record/Replay delivers easy automation testing to everyone, __speeding up delivery of production code__ you can trust.
This allows the continuous delivery process to run smoothly at your organization with a quality selection of functional tests.

Beginners benefit from Record/Replay being ready-to-go as installed. __No coding skills are required to record and to replay tests__. 
Everything you need to start functional testing is included as part of the intuitive user interface.
You can also gain an introduction to different testing frameworks by using our code export functions.

Experienced testers can use Record/Replay to __generate short, unique selectors for all element targets__, using our built-in CSS and Xpath selector generators.
In addition, our code generators __produce code for Jest, Puppeteer, Cypress and Selenium Webdriver__ that you can copy and paste into your testing suites.
This can reduce the amount of time taken to create a full-coverage functional testing suite suitable for multiple different browsers, on your machine or in the cloud.

Install from this repo (master branch), or head to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recordreplay/ggjfmmgmhdopapbclggmlhjdepljpmha) to install a version that benefits from automatic updates.

# WHY IS IT BETTER THAN OTHER TESTING FRAMEWORKS?

Record/Replay is __free and open-source__, which distinguishes it from many other frameworks. We can offer this as there are no cloud-based services attached. 
All test information is saved in local storage and can be passed from one machine to another via export and import of JSON data files.

Record/Replay requires __zero configuration__. High set-up costs can act as a barrier to setting up proper testing, especially for start-ups and those 
that are looking to deliver proof-of-concept skeleton sites quickly to clients. You can start testing your site in minutes, with no previous experience of 
Record/Replay or even testing websites in general.

Record/Replay performs well when __compared with other frameworks__. 
If you have wide experience of existing testing frameworks, you know that automated functional testing can be a tricky process to configure and to maintain. 
Compared to Puppeteer, Record/Replay benefits from using the Chrome browser itself, rather than the headless version, and supports extensions like Flash.
Compared to Cypress, Record/Replay supports the use of the tab key in user interface testing, allows bandwidth / latency throttling and supports iframe interaction by default.
Compared to Selenium Webdriver, Record/Replay is less flaky (prone to erroneous fails), faster to complete tests and provides better reporting.

Of course, this is only our opinion. Just install and give it a try, then make your own mind up! :relaxed:
